/** @page Startup   Startup
 *
 * Quick description of how we startup a process which modules uses LIBC.
 *
 * The load first loads the DLLs of the process, calling their _DLL_InitTerm
 * entrypoints in order of dependencies. If you're using dynamic LIBC this
 * will be initiated first of the LIBC-based modules.
 *
 * LIBCxy.DLL:
 *      - dll0.s gets control and calls __init_dll in sys/__initdll.c
 *          - __init_dll calls __libc_HeapVote() to do the heap voting.
 *          - __init_dll initiates the _osminor and _osmajor globals.
 *          - __init_dll initiates _sys_gcbVirtualAddressLimit global.
 *          - __init_dll initiates _sys_pid and _sys_ppid globals.
 *          - __init_dll creates _sys_heap_fmutex, _sys_gmtxHimem and __libc_gmtxExec.
 *          - __init_dll then initiates __libc_gpTLS with an allocated TLS ULONG.
 *            The thread structure it self isn't initialized untill it's actually
 *            referenced, and when it is there is static structure for the first
 *            thread needing its per thread area.
 *          - __init_dll calls _sys_init_environ() which initializes environ and _org_environ.
 *              - _sys_init_environ() will call _hmalloc() thus initiating the high heap.
 *          - __init_dll calls __libc_spmSelf() which checks initiates SPM and gets
 *            any inherited properties.
 *          - __init_dll calls _sys_init_largefileio() which checks for LFN APIs.
 *          - __init_dll calls __libc_fhInit() which initiates filehandle table.
 *              - __libc_fhInit() will call _hmalloc() and a number of OS/2 APIs
 *                to figure out what handles was inherited.
 *          - __init_dll checks for LIBC_HOOK_DLLS and calls __libc_back_hooksInit()
 *                to process it if it is present in the environment.
 *          - __init_dll then intializes _sys_clock0_ms with the current MS count.
 *      - dll0.s calls _DLL_InitTerm in startup/dllinit.c.
 *          - _DLL_InitTerm calls _CRT_init() in startup/startup.c to initialize the CRT.
 *              - _CRT_init calls init_files() to initialize the file handle tables.
 *              - _CRT_init then call all the crt init functions in __crtinit1__.
 *          - _DLL_InitTerm calls __ctordtorInit() to initate any exception structures and
 *            construct static C++ objects.
 *      - dll0.s then returns to DOSCALL1.DLL and back to the kernel.
 *
 * Your.DLL:
 *      - dll0.s gets control and calls __init_dll() in sys/__initdll.c
 *          - __init_dll calls __libc_HeapVote() to do the heap voting.
 *          - __init_dll then returns since already done during LIBCxy.DLL init.
 *      - dll0.s calls _DLL_InitTerm in startup/dllinit.c.
 *          - _DLL_InitTerm calls _CRT_init() in startup/startup.c to initialize the CRT.
 *              - _CRT_init return at once since already done during LIBCxy.DLL init.
 *          - _DLL_InitTerm calls __ctordtorInit() to initate any exception structures and
 *            construct static C++ objects in _this_ DLL.
 *      - dll0.s then returns to DOSCALL1.DLL and back to the kernel.
 *
 * Your.exe:
 *      - crt0.s gets control and calls ___init_app in sys/386/appinit.s which forwards
 *        the call to __init() in sys/__init.c.
 *          - __init() calls __init_dll() to do common initiation.
 *              - __init_dll calls __libc_HeapVote() to do the heap voting.
 *              - __init_dll then returns since already done during LIBCxy.DLL init.
 *          - __init() parse the commandline to figure out how much stack to use for array
 *            and the argument copy.
 *          - __init() the allocates the stack space space, adding an exception handler struct
 *            and main() callframe.
 *          - __init() parse the commandline creating argv and it's strings using the
 *            allocated stack space.
 *          - __init() calls __libc_spmInheritFree() to release the inherit data (shared)
 *            associated with the current process.
 *          - __init() installs the exception handler.
 *          - __init() set the signal focus.
 *          - __init() then 'returns' thru the hack called ___init_ret in sys/386/appinit.s
 *      - crt0.s now gets control back with esp pointing to a complete callframe for main().
 *      - crt0.s calls _CRT_init() in startup/startup.c to initialize the CRT which returns
 *        immediately since since already done during LIBCxy.DLL init.
 *      - crt0.s the calls main().
 *      - crt0.s then calls exit() with the return value of main().
 *          - exit() will call all the registered at_exit functions.
 *          - exit() will call DosExit with the exit code and terminate the process.
 *
 * @todo update this with file handle changes!
 * @todo update this with fork and performance changes!
